# ATEM Clock Gnome Shell Extension
Based on python code I wrote, inspired by [johanbove/seasonalclock-gnome ](https://github.com/johanbove/seasonalclock-gnome) which was inspired by <https://seasonalclock.org>.

Fork hostd at https://github.com/JThomasKern/atemclock-gnome/tree/main
I loved the idea of the seasonal clock, which makes synchronised hours around the world by being linked to UTC.

But I am far from England, France, Germany, etc and the further away from UTC you go, the more evident the local temporality of many of the emojis. So this clock removes those.

Normal day: morning/afternoon/evening/night

Seasonal Clock: spring/summer/fall/winter
