# Seasonal Hours Clock Gnome Shell Extension

<https://seasonalclock.org/>

This concept originated in [Twodays Crossing](https://github.com/earthstar-project/twodays-crossing), an Earthstar chat app. This clock was created by [@cinnamon-bun](https://github.com/cinnamon-bun). We miss you.

## About

This is a basic implementation of a "Gnome Shell Extension" that displays the current hour as the Seasonal Hour in the form of its representative emoji.
