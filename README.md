# ATEM Clock Gnome Shell Extension
Based on python code I wrote, inspired by [johanbove/seasonalclock-gnome ](https://github.com/johanbove/seasonalclock-gnome) which was inspired by <https://seasonalclock.org>.

I loved the idea of the seasonal clock, which makes synchronised hours around the world by being linked to UTC.

But I am far from England, France, Germany, etc and the further away from UTC you go, the more evident the local temporality of many of the emojis. So this clock removes those.

Normal day: morning/afternoon/evening/night

Seasonal Clock: spring/summer/fall/winter

## About

This is a basic implementation of a ["Gnome Shell Extension"](https://extensions.gnome.org) that displays the current hour as an emoji based remix of the "Seasonal clock" that removed temporally loaded emojis and seasons.

I am testing it at the moment and have not yet submitted it to the gnome extensions.

## Development
2024-12-15 Inital fork. Edited seasonal hours.
