# ATEM Clock Gnome Shell Extension

Based on python code I wrote, inspired by [johanbove/seasonalclock-gnome ](https://github.com/johanbove/seasonalclock-gnome)
which was inspired by <https://seasonalclock.org>.

## About

This is a basic implementation of a ["Gnome Shell Extension"](https://extensions.gnome.org) that displays the current hour as an emoji based remix of the "Seasonal clock" that removed temporally loaded emojis and seasons.

## Development
2024-12-15 Inital fork. Edited seasonal hours.
